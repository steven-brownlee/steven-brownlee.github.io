<h3> About me </h3>

I'm a PhD candidate in the labs of Isabelle Côté and Jonathan Moore at Simon Fraser University. 

My work sits at the intersection of invasion ecology, biogeography and remote sensing, using a comprehensive series of network models, mechanistic niche models and ecosystem models to predict the arrival into, spread throughout and impacts of zebra and quagga mussels in BC.
